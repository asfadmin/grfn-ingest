# About

The Getting Ready for NISAR project (GRFN) is designed to allow project partners the opportunity to work in a commercial cloud environment in order to prepare for the upcoming [NASA-ISRO SAR Mission (NISAR)](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/).  NISAR is expected to produce on the order of 85 Terabytes of data per day, which is a large enough volume of data that possible mission participants need to determine if a commercial cloud environment is an appropriate location in which to process and store this data.  

This repository contains the code developed and used by the [Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)](https://www.asf.alaska.edu) to accept data processed by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.gov)
from the [European Space Agency's](www.esa.int/) [Sentinel-1a/1b](www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1) mission into representative level 2 interferogram data products.  These representative products are then used by ASF to simulate [Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/daacs) operations, including archive, repackaging, cataloging, and distributing the data.
